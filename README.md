* A "Delete" button in the form of a trash can. Click on this option in order to remove a task.
* You can also click on a task, which will result in the task being stricked through, indicating that the task is completed. Use this option if you don't plan on deleting the task completely.

## Features to come:

This app is still being developed so there's still a few things that needs to be added.

* Making the web app more responsive.
